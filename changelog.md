<a name="0.11.0"></a>
## [0.11.0](https://github.com/fasttime/Polytype/releases/tag/0.11.0) (2020-09-23)

* Stricter own property transfer logic in class instantiation: all own properties with the same key
defined by different base constructors or field initializers must be mutually redefinable now, or
else a `TypeError` is thrown.
This change prohibits combining configurable and unconfigurable definitions, or supplying different
unconfigurable definitions unless they have the same enumerability and are all writable.
Other constraints are unchanged:
  * If different own property definitions with the same key are found, the first definition in base
class order is applied.
  * Own property definition order respects base class order.
* Dropped support for older engines.
* Updated documentation.

* Fixed a bug with `super.class(...)` target resolution due to flawed caching.

<a name="0.9.0"></a>
## [0.9.0](https://github.com/fasttime/Polytype/releases/tag/0.9.0) (2020-02-29)

* Fixes and breaking changes in the way `super.class(...)` works:
  * Inside of methods called with `super.class(...).methodName(...)` or
`super.class(...)[methodKey](...)`, the value of `this` is now the same as in the calling context.
  * Increments, decrements and compound assignments on properties of a `super.class(...)` target
work as intended.
  * Getting a property from a `super.class(...)` target no longer throws a `TypeError` in some
special cases where the current object (`this`) has a non‐configurable own property with the same
key.
  * Getting a property with function value from a `super.class(...)` target no longer retrieves the
original function, but a proxy of it.
This is a side effect of other changes.
* New in documentation and code examples: *Dispatching invocations to multiple base classes*.
* Minor improvements to the documentation.
